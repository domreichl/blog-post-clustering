# Blog Post Clustering

My blog (https://www.mindcoolness.com) currently has 322 blog posts, which I have categorized into four broad topics:
- Psychology & Cognitive Science
- Willpower & Self-Improvement
- Philosophy & Spirituality
- Morality & Ethics

Recently, I experienced a curious desire to find out how unsupervised NLP models would cluster my writings, so I've created this notebook.

## Overview

5. Cluster Visualization (MDS, TSNE)
6. Cluster Exploration
7. Predictive Evaluation
8. More Models (NMF, LSA, LDA)
9. Qualitative Evaluation
10. Autoencoder
11. Quantitative Evaluation
12. Conclusion

## Libraries
